# BRM cloud native workshop
## Summary

Service providers and enterprises are increasingly looking to deploy cloud native architectures to modernize and automate their IT operations. BRM provides a cloud native deployment option, supporting Kubernetes-orchestrated containerized components to facilitate continuous integration/continuous delivery and DevOps practices. This allows increased agility and automation, higher availability and lower operating costs.

## Course Objectives

- Understand cloud native technologies used in the BRM cloud native deployment option.
- Learn how to install BRM using Docker containers, Kubernetes and Helm.
- Learn how to configure, customize and operate a cloud native BRM instance.


## Learn about

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
- Cloud native technologies: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, EFK, Prometheus.
- BRM Cloud Native installation procedure.
- Configuring and Customizing a BRM Cloud Native instance.
- Operating a BRM Cloud Native instance.


## Course Content

This is an implementation-level course with hands on labs. Each student will be provided with an OCI environment and as part the activities will:

- Create a Kubernetes cluster using Oracleâ€™s Container Engine for Kubernetes.
- Create a DBaaS instance for the BRM.
- Install BRM using the Cloud Native deployment option.
- Install ECE using the Cloud Native deployment option.
